Number of Slaves - numberOfSlaves

 Latest Developments - 
09-02-2023  Slaves which are at the corner of the beamwidth of Master(5 degree both sides) RSL for such slaves
 depletes because only 20% antenna gain from Master remains for the slaves that are at the end 5 degree of the
Master beam.
16-02-2023  Weighted throughput for all the slaves calculation have been included.

This week -
20-02-2023 Master calculations were included.
Master and slave table resets when num of slaves changed. Markers are removed when number of slaves changed.
Table css were improved for better looks.
Master and Slaves input fields placements changed. Gain kept right after the Radio Type foolowed by Tx power, Height.
Height value have been put to 0 for both Master and slave.

23-02-2023
Added all the Radios properly under their groups.
Now, external radio seletion makes gain go 0. User inputs then calculations happen.
Slave Gain change and Master tx change active now.

24-02-2023
When CPE model is selected throughput is limited to Max 300.

This week 28-02-2023 to 03-03-2023

28-02-2023
Master Radios : when ion4l2BTS is selected the Master beamwidth consideration is 90 in calculations.
When ion4l1BTS is selected MAster beamwidth considered is 60 degrees.

01-03-2023
Polyline between the Marker with Green/Red indicating whether the slave is in Master BeamWidth
(60 for ion4l2BTs and 90 for ion4l1BTS) range and Distance(5 Km) or not.

Upto 11 slaves possible now.

06 and 07 feb
Working on Installation report.

09-03-2023
Installation Report layout is coming without any data just plain tables.
In installation report, we now have map and statistics information.

10-03-2023
In map, Markers and polyline now is visible.
Link Summary Information is populated.
When number of slaves are changed, then the js created divs for the link report gets deleted,
in order to allow new elements to be created. 

13-03-2023
Included units to the tables for Master and slave parameters.
Polyline Red/ Green in Report done.
Bandwidth and frequency values swapped as previously they were coming interchanged.
Representation : Slave {number} Summary in Report.
Print report is possible.
